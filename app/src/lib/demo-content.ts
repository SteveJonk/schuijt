/**
 * Demo copy for every block.
 *
 * This file has two jobs, and they are deliberately the same data:
 *
 *  1. Component defaults — each block in `src/components/blocks` falls back to
 *     these values when the CMS has not supplied a field, so the site renders
 *     something sensible before any content exists.
 *  2. Seed source — `scripts/seed/*.ts` pushes these same values into Sanity,
 *     so a freshly seeded studio matches what you see on screen.
 *
 * The copy is written for an invented studio so a seeded site looks like a real
 * site rather than a style guide. It is filler: replace it. Every string here
 * is generic on purpose, so nothing breaks when you swap in your own.
