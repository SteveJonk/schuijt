/**
 * Seed Sanity content. Runs every target, or only the ones you name.
 *
 * Usage (from app/):
 *   npm run seed                 # everything
 *   npm run seed:home            # one page
 *   npm run seed:site            # the site information singleton
 *   npm run seed:forms           # form settings + the demo contact form
 *   npm run seed -- home nav
 *
 * Each target is idempotent and only touches its own documents, so seeding one
 * page leaves the others alone. Page content is defined per page in
 * scripts/seed/<page>.ts and comes from src/lib/demo-content.ts.
 *
 * ADDING A PAGE: create scripts/seed/<page>.ts exporting a `seed<Page>`
 * function, then register it in TARGETS below and add an npm script.
